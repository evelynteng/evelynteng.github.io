            I participated in the Non-Trivial Fellowship's July 2024 cohort. This program allowed me to spend 
            time doing what I normally do (going down rabbit holes) in addition to having the chance to make an 
            impact. For the global issue I chose to address, I selected biosecurity, not only because of my 
            interest in public health, global well-being and medicine, but also due to the recent COVID-19 
            pandemic. The more I looked into it, the more I realised how few laws and regulations existed 
            for biolabs. One thing that struck me was the presence of private biolabs. I explain more in my
            proposal linked below:

                I could have ever imagined. It started with being lessons on rationality and effective
                altruism, and I hope I am correct in saying that I came out the other side a better thinker, and 
                more importantly, a better person. Massive thank you to my facilitators Rhea and Noah (as well 
                as feedback wizard Sch√§fer) who guided
                me through this fellowship and not only helped me on the journey of writing my proposal, but 
                who encouraged me to use this opportunity to take a deep dive into the topic of biosecurity. I 
                would also like to thank Mr Dan Greene for hopping on a call with me a few weeks ago - I gained 
                so much real-world insight and believe that the expert suggestions really did help refine my plan.
                I am ever so grateful for this opportunity: to have met so many like-minded people, to 
                engage with some of the most knowledgeable people in the world, to have had the chance 
                to work on something so much bigger than myself.
