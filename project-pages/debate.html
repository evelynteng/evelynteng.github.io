          <div class="body-text">The SJIIM STEM Debate Competition 2024 was a completely student-led competition that was organised 
            by the St. Joseph's Science Society (a club that I founded and currently lead) that involved bringing in  high school students from 
            schools in Malaysia to discuss
            pressing topics and global issues. The motions debated upon were based around the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
            focused on giving students a platform to advocate for
            a future they want to live in. I believe that more events like this should take place, because as global issues become more urgent and
            increase in number, it is the younger generations that should have a say in what their futures should look like.
