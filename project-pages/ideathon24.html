            propose a public health measure or piece of legislation 
            to minimise environmental exposures which may contribute to neurodegenerative disease risk. The neurodegenerative 
            disease we picked was Alzheimer's, given its prevalence and the fact that it contributes to around 60 to 80 percent 
            of all dementia cases. We were then tasked to write a research proposal and present it to a panel of judges. Big thank
            you to the International Youth Neuroscience Association for organising this event and for giving me the opportunity
            to win First Place!

              This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

              Full Width Image:

                <div class="gallery-image-container">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">
                  <span class="image-caption">IMAGE_CAPTION</span>
                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
