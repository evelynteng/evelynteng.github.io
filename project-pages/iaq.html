          <div class="body-text">The theme for my school's science fair this year was "Connections". I saw a lot of potential in the connections that exist in
            circuits and I also wanted to create something that was useful. At the time, the haze in Malaysia was quite bad and we had to make sure we weren't
            outside for extended periods of time. Hence, I made this IAQ monitor so that it could connect to a phone app (using BlynkIOT) and so that it could
            check for things like fine particulate or smoke in the air, as well as the general uses of an air monitor to keep track of temperature and humidity.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">This project was actually the first time I coded something properly and without a tutorial so it was a very new experience. 
            I didn't have much knowledge of Arduino as I had mostly been learning Python, HTML and JavaScript, so using C++ took some getting used to. There were
            a lot of times where I had to refer to the very basics and work my way up, so I think this project may not have been very complicated, but is one that has taught
            me a lot.

              Full Width Image:

                <div class="gallery-image-container">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
