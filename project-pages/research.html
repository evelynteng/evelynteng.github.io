          <div class="body-text"><div class="body-text">When I first began writing this review paper, it was quite overwhelming, to say the least.
            Doing an Extended Essay for the IB was a lot different from this, especially since I did an experimental EE and not a review paper. 
            This was definitely a new experience, but one that I'm super grateful for. 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text"><div class="body-text">There was a lot of unlearning involved. I had to unlearn how to approach research as something 
            linear or neatly structured. With an experimental paper, you’re guided by the data you produce: you see results appear, patterns emerge, 
            and your analysis follows. But with a review, the data is scattered across dozens of studies. The goal here wasn't to produce new findings
            or even necessarily corroborate existing ones, but rather to make sense of what already existed.
        </div>
        
        <div class="body-text"><div class="body-text">At first, I underestimated how hard that would be. I thought reading enough papers would eventually 
            reveal a clear narrative. But I found myself constantly having to rewrite what I knew instead. One assumed conclusion could be shown incorrect 
            by a new piece of evidence; another might need restructuring after realising two studies defined the same biomarker in completely different ways. 
            It was definitely frustrating initially, but it also forced me to think more critically, and to stop treating published research as the one simple truth,
             and to start viewing it as an ongoing process.

        <div class="body-text"><div class="body-text">Somewhere in that process, I truly saw how much patience research demands. Sometimes, it feels like the 
            information is never-ending and that you're making next to no progress, but it seems research always rewards persistence. Synthesis is about 
            being able to balance contradictions and discuss different conclusions or evidence to see the bigger picture emerge.

                something in this ever-expanding field of study. This 10-week long process was certainly tough and it is 
                with the support of my incredible mentors Dr Kimberly Clark and Ms Monika Rybak that I was able to 
                push through and reach publication in a journal that accepts less than 15% of all submissions. Writing this 
                taught me the skills involved in research, and can definitely say it's helped me understand what 
                science is like. Massive thank you as well to the Convergence Journal who provided a platform for this research 
                to be published on!
