            We decided to do our research project on investigating the efficacy of natural antimicrobials
            on bacteria, because industrial antiseptics often contain chemicals that, although 
            work very well against bacteria, can be very harmful to the environment. The packaging that 
            these antiseptic agents come in also tend to be made of plastic, meaning 
            that it is not biodegradable. Using natural antimicrobials can be a solution that provides 
            a healthier and more sustainable alternative to chemical antimicrobials.

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
