                how to put together a science project. It's taught me resilience, determination, quick thinking, 
                communication and a plethora of other skills. Even though it started with an idea that didn't quite work out, 
                I most certainly am thankful for the chance to have pushed myself by 
                having to think and work under a very tight time constraint (~a week). A huge
                thank you to my teammates and friends James and Amni who stuck with me throughout this project.
                I am ever so thankful for an opportunity like this: to have a platform on which to share 
                my ideas and, in turn, learn so much from other people and to 
                engage with some of the best young scientists this part of the world has to offer.
