        <div class="body-text">
            Out of many other high school students, I was selected to intern under
            Assistant Professor Dr Loo Shu San to complete a research task on 
            Bioinformatics. This experience was absolutely wonderful because I got 
            to meet so many like-minded students from a lot of other international 
            schools as well as being to learn things I wouldn't be able to learn
            about in school. 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            I was incredibly lucky to be able to work under Dr Loo and with a student
            from another school. During this internship, we got to work with a variety
            of bioinformatics software such as DNAStar and MEGA11. Using these two 
            softwares, I was able to identify unknown species of bacteria by matching
            their gene sequences with the sequences of known bacteria species. My 
            teammate did the same with different animal species.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            A massive thank you to Dr Loo and UoN Malaysia for allowing me to 
            have this wonderful experience!

              This is where the images in the gallery live. Here's a simple gallery image for you to copy:

              Full Width Image:

                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
