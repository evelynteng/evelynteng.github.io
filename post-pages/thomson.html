        <div class="main-title">Interning at the Neurology and Emergency Department at Thomson Hospital Kota Damansara</div>
       
        <div class="body-text">
            This summer, I was fortunate enough to have shadowed and interned at Thomson Hospital in Kota Damansara. Being 
            attached to Dr Hadi in the Emergency Department and Dr Tan in the Neurology Department gave me super useful 
            insights into the healthcare field, especially for those on the frontlines. 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">When I first walked into the hospital, I really didn't know what to expect. 
            I thought I’d mostly just be observing, standing in the corner, taking notes, 
            and trying not to get in anyone’s way. And because I don't have a medical degree, 
            that was very much the case, but what I didn’t expect was how alive the hospital would feel.
            It was a very strange mix and oscillation of being chaotic and strangely calm, 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">By the end of my two weeks in the ER, I had a full logbook of pretty much all 
            the common diseases: heart attacks, dengue, appendicitis, strokes, influenza... The list 
            goes on and on. It would be an understatement to say that I've learned a lot. Even within 
            just two weeks, I feel that I've learned more about the human anatomy and pathology than I 
            have in my three years of Biology lessons. Perhaps it is because medicine is purely focused 
            on human biology, and a standard school syllabus doesn't usually go into the specifics of 
            diagnosing disease. I also became a lot more well-versed in reading doctor 
            handwriting on patient charts and all the abbreviations that were used. (It made a lot more sense 
            when someone was diagnosed with AGE (acute gastroenteritis, not the natural process of getting older)!)
            Thank you to Dr Hadi for finding time in your busy medical-director schedule to give us 
            short crash courses on anginas and intubation! Also, thank you to Saira for keeping me company in the 
            quieter hours!
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            The neurology department offered a really different perspective into healthcare. It was a lot more about 
            long-term patients and building a relationship with them. A lot of these people had been coming to Thomson's 
            for months to years, usually to follow up after a stroke or brain surgery. Morbid as it may be, 
            it was quite fascinating to see the brain scans of stroke patients immediately after diagnosis and 
            six months into recovery. I find it incredible that the brain 
            was capable of regenerating itself in this way. Thank you to Dr Tan for allowing me to attach for two weeks!
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            I am endlessly grateful to have had this opportunity to witness
            what being a healthcare provider is really like. 
            I look forward to applying the knowledge and 
            experience I’ve gained to make a meaningful impact in the future!
