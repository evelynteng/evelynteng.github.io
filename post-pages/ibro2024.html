        <div class="main-title">Cerebral Organoids Model for Ageing Neurobiology Research - A Conference by the International Brain Research Organisation</div>
       
        <div class="body-text">
            Right after my internship at UPM under Dr Rachel, I had the privilege
            of being able to attend a Symposium where experts were invited to share
            their findings and research. More specifically, it was about the use of 
            cerebral organoids as models for ageing neurobiology research. To me, this 
            was definitely a very new experience because I had never attended anything 
            even remotely similar, but it was an experience I truly enjoyed because I 
            got to learn what was happening at the forefront of scientific discvoery.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            Cerebral organoids are three-dimensional cultures derived from pluripotent 
            stem cells (PSCs). Essentially, they're mini-brains that mimic the structural 
            and functional properties of the 
            human brain. These organoids are grown in vitro and recapitulate key aspects 
            of brain development, which has provided scientists with a unique model to study neural tissue in a 
            controlled environment. During the symposium, several experts highlighted 
            how cerebral organoids bridge the gap between traditional two-dimensional cell 
            cultures and animal models, which are then able to offer more physiologically relevant insights.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            I was particularly interested in Dr Mather's keynote lecture on the hallmarks
            of an ageing brain and Professor Dr Sun's lecture on the technical aspects 
            of using cerebral organoids (i.e. scalable production for things like drug 
            screening and nerve regeneration). There was so much new information, but I 
            learned so much just by listening to these incredible lecturers. 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            With this, I've realised how incredibly privileged I am to be attending such 
            a talk. As a high school student, these opportunities are definitely difficult 
            to come by. This is why I am looking forward to hopefully working with some of these 
            professors to establish a Youth Division of the Society for Neurosciences or a 
            Malaysian Chapter under the International Youth Neuroscience Association! 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            A massive thank you to Dr Michael and his team at UPM for putting this whole 
            symposium together and allowing me to have this wonderful experience!

                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
