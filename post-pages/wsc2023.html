            This was my second year as a WSC scholar, so I was a lot more excited
            than I was nervous. This was my first year as a Senior scholar which
            meant going up against people in Years 12 and 13, which was intimidating
            at first, but everyone was so friendly and passionate.

            My team and I ended up with First Place and lots of trophies + medals.
            As always, I'm very grateful to have had this opportunity to compete
            and meet so many passionate and curious scholars!

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">
