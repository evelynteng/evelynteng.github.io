        <div class="body-text">
            As a Deputy Leader of the Lasallian Youth Movement (my school's
            service-oriented, student-led extracurricular activity), 
            it is both an honour and responsibility to be able to organise the 
            school's annual event: Founder's  Week. Since the school was founded, 
            this event has been instrumental in building a sense of community 
            spirit and appreciation for our school. 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            In this week, we carried out a variety of service projects and
            activities like fundraising and volunteering activites. Just by
            selling Founder's Day t-shirts, we raised more than RM3000
            and donated the amount, along with donation boxes with food items
            and other essentials, to the homes. We also invited some kids
            from the home to come over to our school on the weekend for a fun 
            day out. 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            Along with this, we organised a flashmob and involved the Elementary School 
            to make lots of little crafts to put up around the school to
            celebrate. We strung up virtue chains on the staircases and did 
            something we like to call Project Hello where we stand in the 
            foyer every morning and say hello to everyone coming into school. Some 
            members of the LYM also painted a mural on the wall to commemorate
            the event.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            A big thank you to all four of my amazing LYM Leadership teammates 
            and everyone who participated in this event for making it possible! 
            This event is one of the best events I've ever organised and taken part in.
            Happy Founder's Day!
