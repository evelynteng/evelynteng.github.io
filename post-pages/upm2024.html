        <div class="main-title">Being an intern at Universiti Putra Malaysia's Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.</div>
       
        <div class="body-text">
            This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at 
            Universiti Putra Malaysia's Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences
            under the supervision of Dr Mok Pooi Ling. This internship gave me
            the chance to dive deep into biomedical research in tissues and stem cells. 
            Over the course of the last four weeks, I was able to engage in hands-on 
            experiments, learn advanced scientific techniques, and experience 
            the day-to-day work of a research lab.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            During this internship, I got to work with a variety of equipment
            and techniques involving cell cultures, tissue staining, bioinformatics,
            histology and animal models. Using ImageJ as my main software, I was able 
            to help in identifying elastin percentage in blood vessels, amounts of scar tissue and 
            quantify cell apoptosis in a given stained sample.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            My internship at UPM was a period of immense growth and learning. 
            Each day brought new challenges that I was more than eager to immerse
            myself in, from troubleshooting experiments 
            that didn’t go as planned to quickly adapting to new techniques. 
            I realised that research is not just about results, but also about 
            persistence, critical thinking, and collaboration. The mentorship 
            I received was invaluable, and I learned how to approach problems 
            with a scientific mindset. 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            As I look ahead, I am so excited to have the chance to continue
            exploring these areas, whether through my studies, future internships, 
            or personal projects. In conclusion, my time at UPM has been a 
            transformative experience 
            that has equipped me with new and valuable technical skills. I am grateful for 
            the opportunity to have been a part of such an innovative and dynamic 
            environment, and I look forward to applying the knowledge and 
            experience I’ve gained to make a meaningful impact in the field!
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            A massive thank you to Dr Rachel and her research team at UPM for allowing me to 
            have this wonderful experience!
