        <div class="body-text">
            I had the privilege of being invited to the 2023 FOBISIA Annual Leadership 
            Conference held in Kuala Lumpur to speak alongside five other students from
            international schools across KL. We shared our experiences as students with 
            Head Teachers from British international schools across Asia. This opportunity 
            to contribute to the dialogue on how schools can embrace change, collaboration and
            inclusivity was both an honour and responsibility.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            As a student who is fortunate enough to be able to attend an international
            school, I have had the privilege of being able to learn in a very culturally
            diverse environment. I believe this has certainly shaped the way I view the 
            world around me and the opportunities that I was exposed to growing up. 
            For that, I am incredibly thankful.

                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
