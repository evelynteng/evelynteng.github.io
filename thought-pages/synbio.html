            <div class="body-text">The 2024 chemistry Nobel was awarded to John Jumper and Demis Hassabis at Google DeepMind 
            for the development of a game-changing AI tool. This AI tool, called AlphaFold, was able to predict protein structures. 
            Not only has AlphaFold helped reveal millions of intricate 3D protein structures, it has also helped scientists 
            understand how life's molecules interact, and is also completely free to start off with. I had a great time using 
            the software to model proteins, such as their template Protein-RNA-Ion: PDB 8AW3, but also haemoglobin and antibodies 
            (the genetic code for which I found on online datasets like Genbank). It’s fascinating to finally be able to see not 
            just the 2D representation of a structure, but the actual 3D make-up of proteins!

                what we know about haemoglobin and its shape, this algorithm has generated a pretty solid and accurate 3D visualisation 
                of the protein itself. According to an article, how it works is that Alphafold takes the amino acid sequence at the simplest 
                level and predicts the positions and bond angles of molecules in 3D space. What surprised me was that Alphafold 
                actually uses unsupervised learning in a way similar to GPT-3. GPT-3 learns the general features of a language 
                by using unlabelled text data in a similar way to how Alphafold learns embedding from the sequence of proteins 
                with similar functions.

                    <div class="body-text">Forbes has credited Alphafold as "The Most Important Achievement in AI"
                    and for good reason. The protein folding problem has stood as a grand challenge in the field of biology for half 
                    a century. To determine a protein’s three-dimensional shape based solely on the one-dimensional string of molecules 
                    that comprise it has been “one of the most important yet unsolved issues of modern science". Sure, it can theoretically 
                    be done by hand, but the number of different configurations that a protein might fold into is astronomical. 
                    According to Levinthal’s paradox, any given protein can theoretically adopt about 10^300 different configurations. Each 
                    configuration could generate a different shape that would serve a different function within the body.

                <div class="body-text"><div class="body-text">To give an idea of just how influential AlphaFold has been, we knew the 3D 
                    structures for only about 17% of the roughly 20,000 proteins in the human body before the invention of AlphaFold. 
                    Those protein structures that we did know had been painstakingly worked out by hand in a laboratory over several decades through 
                    tedious experiments involving the likes Of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance, all of which require 
                    multi-million-dollar equipment, and months or even years of brute-forced trial and error. With AlphaFold, we now have 3D
                     structures for virtually all (98.5%) of the human proteome. According to a Forbes article, of these, 36% are predicted 
                     with very high accuracy and another 22% are predicted with high accuracy. With the knowledge of the shape of each protein, 
                     scientists are now able to 
                     see how different molecules interact with each other, which is gamechanging for fields like medicine and bioengineering!
